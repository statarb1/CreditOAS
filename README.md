# CreditOAS
The analysis in this paper discussed the evolving nature of credit spreads and also changing composition of credit indices. The analysis looks at using the option adjusted spread (OAS) for credit indices as predictors for future returns. The analysis demonstrated that option adjusted spreads are a great predictor for future return for corporate bonds (both investment grade and high yield bonds).
